## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on muti-echo fMRI, [resting-state](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/6/1130.abstract) fMRI and the [neurobiology of spontaneous thoughts](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.05.596482v1.abstract).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about [Dimensionality Reduction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2023.1134012/full), Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that use dynamic visualization libraries in Python.
