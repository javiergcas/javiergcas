## Hi there!
*** 
My name is Javier. I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer, turned Biomedical Engineer/Neuroscientist deeply interested in all things Data Science, Machine Learning and AI.

- ðŸ§  I work with large functional MRI datasets to gain new insights about how our brians are organized, and to explore the [neurobiology of spontaneous thoughts](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.05.596482v1.abstract).
  
- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently learning about [Dimensionality Reduction](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2023.1134012/full), Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that apply machine learning and AI to undertand complex, lage datasets and also projects looking to build dashboards using [Python dynamic visualization libraries](https://holoviz.org).
